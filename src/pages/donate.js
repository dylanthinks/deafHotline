        It takes a community to thrive together. 

We have seen, as a community, that abuse thrives in isolation. Survivors come out from abusive relationships and share their experiences––experiences hidden behind closed doors for most of us to notice. 

So how do we give more support, beyond our current advocacy, therapy, and placement services we provide? We need flourishing community-made resources and education. 

You can help with our materials development. Your support is key in solving this problem.

Would you consider donating to help us change the lives of survivors and build a thriving community? 

Your donation will have a profound impact on survivors and will be used to fund educational resources and further support for survivors fleeing abuse.

With warm regards,

ADWAS
