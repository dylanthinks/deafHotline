How to Take Care of Yourself 
-Know you are not alone, there are others LGBTQIA people who are going through the same struggles.

-Talk to someone you feel the most comfortable with or who you trust. If you have nobody to talk to. Feel free to reach out to us and connect with deaf hotline advocates. We are available 24/7.

-Do things that you enjoy the most; e.g., spend time in nature, play with pets, or draw/write to express your feelings, and engage in some other self-care activities.

-Make a safety plan when you need to escape or find a place to feel safer. We can help you out by developing a safety plan with you.
