Services Offered by the Deaf Hotline
All survivors of domestic violence face the same issue: abuse thrives in isolation. This can be especially true for survivors of domestic violence who are Deaf, DeafBlind or hard of hearing. Domestic violence programs can still isolate survivors by not providing adequate access to critical information. 

Our hotline strives to educate the public about the need for Deaf, DeafBlind and hard of hearing abuse outreach programs. The safe and strictly confidential services that our hotline offers Deaf survivors can be life-saving. We have partnered with the Abused Deaf Women’s Advocacy Services (ADWAS) to ensure Deaf advocates are available to respond through email, live chat, and video phone to those seeking help.

Abuse in the Deaf Community – Learn about the specific and unique barriers that victims of domestic violence who are Deaf or hard of hearing may face, and the resources that we offer at our hotline. 

Support for the Deaf Community – Our safe and strictly confidential services that we offer to Deaf survivors can be life-saving. Call us at 1-855-812-1001, open up a live chat on this website, or email us at nationaldeafhotline@adwas.org.

Resources and Outreach – We offer resources to educate people about Deaf culture and accessibility. Part of this covers how family violence programs can help Deaf, DeafBlind, and hard of hearing survivors. We also provide resources and links to Deaf programs from all over.
