        <h3>Abuse In the Deaf Community</h3>

<h4>
  Deaf victims of domestic violence often face unique circumstances:
</h4>

Information can travel quickly within a Deaf, DeafBlind or hard of hearing community, compromising confidentiality and the victim’s safety.
Law enforcement and shelters are often not skilled at communicating with Deaf, DeafBlind or hard of hearing individuals and often don’t have interpreters.
Their abusive partners may take away their communication devices.
Their abusive partners may give false information to the victim to make them believe they have fewer options.
The victim may be isolated from family, friends, services, resources and options.

<h4>
  According to DeafHope these are some examples of what victims face and the tactics abusive partners use to abuse the Deaf:
</h4>

Intimidation through gestures, facial expressions, or exaggerated signs, floor stomping and pounding on the table or door
Signing very close to a victim’s face when angry
Criticizing  the victim’s American sign language (ASL) skills or communication style
Not informing the victim when people try to call on the phone or try to catch their attention
Excluding the victim from important conversations
Leaving the victim out in social situations with hearing people
Talking negatively about the Deaf community
Wrongly interpreting to manipulate the situation if the police are called
Not allowing children to use ASL to talk with the victim
Not allowing children to be proud of Deaf culture
Criticizing the victim’s speech and English skills
