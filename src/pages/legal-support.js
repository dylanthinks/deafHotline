        Depending on your situation, you might determine that taking legal action against an abusive partner is the best course for you.

Please note: The Deaf Hotline does not give legal advice, nor are we legal advocates. We may be able to help you locate a legal advocate in your area if needed. Our advocates can connect you with resources for legal help.

You can also visit <a href="http://www.womenslaw.org/">WomensLaw.org</a> and search state by state for information on laws including restraining orders and child custody information.

Not a U.S. citizen? Learn more at <a href="http://www.casadeesperanza.org/">Casa de Esperanza</a> about your rights as an immigrant and read more on our site.

According to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), immigrant women who are experiencing domestic violence — and are married to abusers who are U.S. Citizens or Legal Permanent Residents — may qualify to self-petition for legal status under VAWA. Get more information <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/">here</a>.

If your life is in danger, please call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number.
